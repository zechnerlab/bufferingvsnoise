# Concentration buffering and noise reduction in phase separating systems

## Experimental data
The paper uses previously published concentration measurements of intracellular condensates. Data relating to 2NTDDX4-YFP were originally published in Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S22 in Klosin et al., Science, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav6691). Measurements of endogenously labelled NPM1 (NPM1-NeonGreen) were published in the same study in Figure 3f. The data is included in the folder "CaseStudies/ExperimentalData/" with permission from Adam Klosin and Anthony A Hyman.
